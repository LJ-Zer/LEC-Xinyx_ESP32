# LEC-Xinyx_ESP32 (LAB-EARTH + C Xinyx Unlocked 2024 ADI ESP32 38 Pin Source Codes) 
LAB-EARTH + C as a hardware itself is a seamless and compact version of a typical weather station which features relevant and highly-demand systems, providing information about the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, rain predictions, air quality, and cloud formations.

## The following folders are the modified source codes from the libraries of Arduino.
This innovative solution to environmental challenges aims to build community resilience. This is a seamless and compact version of a typical weather station which features relevant and highly-demand systems, providing information about the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, rain predictions, air quality, and cloud formations. The LAB-EARTH + C also features decision-making algorithms. This process involves analyzing weather data to provide recommendations. The dashboard will gather information and provide users with suggestions about the weather conditions and events expected for the day. In addition, this project also features the implementation of an air quality monitoring system. The system allows for the constant tracking of different pollutants like Nitrogen dioxide, Ammonia, Carbon dioxide, and Sulfur Oxide in selected areas across local municipalities. The data will be more efficient and high quality to be delivered locally without compromising the size and energy that can be used to implement the integrated systems. The system uses LoRa transmitter and receiver modules used as a transmission protocol of the whole project.

## Main Branch:
Reference code used.

## dev-John Branch:
This branch is a complete versions of the codes from transmitter and receiver, mainly the Lab-Earth-1 and Lab-Earth-2 folders. And other folders are just the draft code before the main compilation.
